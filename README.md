# Cross-It-The-Game

This repo consists of code, physics materials, game characters, models, animations and shaders used for the making of an adventure game named "CROSS-IT". This game is made in Unity3D Game Developement Engine. Used Blender for making the game character and other game models. The C# scripts are written in MonoDevelop IDE.

This game was recognized as one of the outstanding projects in our university.

### How to run:
For playing the game all you have to do is just clone the whole project or download the `Cross-it.zip` file to you local system and unzip it.
Upon unzipping you will see two files one is `cross-it data` and the other one is `cross-it.exe`, these two are present inside the `pc` folder. Now, all that's left is just double clicking on the `cross-it.exe` file. Enjoy playing the game :).

The `cross-it data` folder contains the data that is required for the game to run.

I've uploaded all the code here. So, feel free to play around with it and If you want to collaborate, you are most welcome :)
